## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

* If a user entered an invalid key (e.g. p or t), output “Enter U, D, L or R.) and allow the user to enter again
* The number of holes generated should be lesser than the fields generated
* When the character drops into a hole, output “Sorry, you fell down a hole!” and the game ends
* When the character hits the boundaries, output “Out of bounds - Game End!” and the game ends
* When the character gets the hat, output “Congrats, you found your hat!” and and the game ends

### Reflections

- what did i like about this project?
This project test your knowledge on loops, control statements, classes, static methods, Arrays and npm. I liked the challenge and the way it was presented.

- what did i struggle with in this project?
The problem i had was with moving the * up, down, right and left and figuring what changes should i made to the x & y in relation to the 2D array.

- what would you make your experience with this assessment better?
For me, i had done similar projects previously which i had more time to do it. I just felt my fellow classmates who are less experienced had more practice on this type of projects.
